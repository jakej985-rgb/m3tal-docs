# M3TAL System Documentation

This document provides technical details and operational procedures for the M3TAL system.

## Prerequisites

Docker Engine and Docker Compose V2 are strictly REQUIRED and must be installed prior to M3TAL installation and operation. M3TAL internally orchestrates Docker containers using Docker Engine and Docker Compose V2.

## Installation

To install the M3TAL CLI and API daemon via APT:

```bash
# 1. Add the GPG signing key
curl -fsSL https://jakej985-rgb.github.io/m3tal-apt-key/public.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/m3tal-archive-keyring.gpg

# 2. Add the APT repository
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/m3tal-archive-keyring.gpg] https://jakej985-rgb.github.io/m3tal-apt-key stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/m3tal.list

# 3. Install
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y m3tal
```

## Firewall Considerations

If you are using Traefik for public-facing access (i.e., `DASHBOARD_EXPOSE_MODE=traefik` or exposing other services via Traefik), ensure that host port `80` (and `443` if HTTPS is configured) is open in your firewall (e.g., `ufw allow 80/tcp`).

## System Components

The M3TAL system comprises the following core components:

*   **CLI binary** (`/usr/bin/m3tal`): A unified Go binary providing a single entrypoint for system operations.
*   **API daemon** (`m3tal-api.service`): A Go binary running as a systemd service, listening on host-local port `8080`. It manages Docker interactions, the state database, and API routes.
*   **Dashboard container** (`m3tal-dashboard`): A Python/Flask application running in a Docker container, internally listening on port `8082`. It communicates with the API daemon via `http://host.docker.internal:8080`.
*   **Traefik gateway** (`routing-compose.yml`): A Docker container acting as a reverse proxy, exposing services by domain name on host port `80`. It utilizes a file provider for dynamic routing configuration.
*   **Cloudflared** (`routing-compose.yml`): An optional Cloudflare tunnel container, enabling zero-configuration internet access for services.

## Filesystem Contract

The following table details the critical directories and files within the M3TAL filesystem:

| Path                        | Purpose                                                                |
| :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/etc/m3tal/.env`           | Primary configuration file. Managed by `m3tal config wizard`.          |
| `/var/lib/m3tal/state.db`   | SQLite state database. Automatically created by the API daemon.        |
| `/opt/m3tal/stack/`         | Canonical stack directory. Contains Docker Compose files and Traefik configuration. |
| `/docker`                   | Symlink to `/opt/m3tal/stack/`. This is the user-facing path for all Docker Compose stack operations. |
| `/docker/users.json`        | Dashboard credential store. Managed by `m3tal dashpass`.               |

## Deployment Lifecycle

M3TAL orchestrates Docker containers using Docker Compose V2. The `m3tal up` command is a wrapper around `docker compose` that operates on all `*-compose.yml` files located within the `/docker/` directory, effectively deploying each as an independent stack.

The `/opt/m3tal/stack/` directory is the canonical source of truth where all M3TAL-managed Docker Compose stack files reside. The `/docker` directory serves as a user-facing symlink alias to `/opt/m3tal/stack/`, simplifying all stack-related operations from the user's perspective.

### Adding a New Stack

To deploy a new Docker Compose stack:
1.  Place your Docker Compose file (e.g., `my-stack-compose.yml`) directly into the `/docker/` directory. This file will be automatically included by `m3tal up`.
2.  Ensure any required environment variables are set in `/etc/m3tal/.env` (use `m3tal config wizard` or `m3tal config set KEY value`).
3.  Run `m3tal up` to initiate or update all Docker Compose stacks, including your new service.

## Dashboard Access

The M3TAL Dashboard can be accessed in two primary modes, controlled by the `DASHBOARD_EXPOSE_MODE` variable in `/etc/m3tal/.env`.

### Local Mode (Default)

*   **Configuration**: `DASHBOARD_EXPOSE_MODE=local` (default setting).
*   **Mechanism**: This mode utilizes an override file (`m3tal-compose.local.yml`) to add a direct port binding: `${DASHBOARD_PORT:-8082}:8082`.
*   **Access**: Directly via `http://HOST_IP:8082` or `http://localhost:8082`.
*   **Note**: A new user performing a default M3TAL installation will access the dashboard directly via port 8082. Traefik is not required for this mode.
*   **Use Case**: Ideal for LAN-only setups, first-time users, or local testing environments.

### Traefik Mode

*   **Configuration**: `DASHBOARD_EXPOSE_MODE=traefik`.
*   **Mechanism**: This mode utilizes an override file (`m3tal-compose.traefik.yml`) to apply Traefik labels to the dashboard container. Traefik then routes `dash.${DOMAIN}` to the dashboard container on its internal port `8082`.
*   **Access**: Via `http://dash.DOMAIN` (requires Traefik to be running via `m3tal up` and `DOMAIN` to be configured).
*   **Use Case**: Suited for domain-based setups and environments where multiple services are exposed through a single reverse proxy.

## Traefik Gateway

Traefik automatically discovers and routes traffic to Docker services by interpreting Traefik labels defined within their Docker Compose service definitions. Crucially, services are not exposed by Traefik by default and require `traefik.enable=true` along with other relevant labels to be discoverable and routable.

Traefik loads dynamic configuration from `/docker/dynamic/` (which is mapped to `/etc/traefik/dynamic` inside the Traefik container) using a file provider. This allows for hot-reloading of routing rules.

*   **API Daemon Routing**: Traefik routes `api.DOMAIN` to the M3TAL Go API daemon, which listens on the host-local port `8080`. This is achieved through a dynamic configuration file (e.g., `dynamic/api.yml`) which defines a service pointing to `http://host.docker.internal:8080`.
*   **Dashboard Routing**: When `DASHBOARD_EXPOSE_MODE=traefik`, Traefik routes `dash.DOMAIN` to the `m3tal-dashboard` container by interpreting Traefik labels applied in `m3tal-compose.traefik.yml`.

### Example: Exposing a Custom User Service via Traefik

To expose a custom user service (e.g., an Nginx container named `my-app`) via Traefik, add the following labels to its service definition in your `my-app-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  my-app:
    image: nginx:alpine
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.myapp.rule=Host(`app.DOMAIN`)"
      - "traefik.http.services.myapp.loadbalancer.server.port=80"
      - "traefik.http.routers.myapp.entrypoints=web"
    networks:
      - proxy # Ensure your service is part of the 'proxy' network for Traefik discovery

networks:
  proxy:
    external: true # Assumes the 'proxy' network is external and created by Traefik
```

## Service Management

The M3TAL API daemon is managed as a systemd service named `m3tal-api.service`. You can control and monitor its status using standard `systemctl` commands:

*   **Check status**: `systemctl status m3tal-api`
*   **Restart service**: `systemctl restart m3tal-api`
*   **View logs**: `journalctl -u m3tal-api -f`

## Quick Demo

*   To start only the M3TAL Dashboard container:
    ```bash
    m3tal dash up
    ```
    If `DASHBOARD_EXPOSE_MODE=local` (the default), the dashboard will be accessible at `http://HOST_IP:8082`.

*   To orchestrate and deploy all other stacks in the `/docker/` directory, including any user-defined Docker Compose files:
    ```bash
    m3tal up
    ```
    This command will bring up Traefik, Cloudflared, and any other Docker Compose services found in `*-compose.yml` files within `/docker/`.

## Port Map

The following table lists the primary network ports utilized by the M3TAL system:

| Port | Service | Access | Description |
| :--- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 80   | Traefik HTTP entry point    | Public                                         | The public-facing HTTP port for services exposed via Traefik.                                        |
| 8080 | M3TAL API daemon (Go)       | Host-local                                     | The internal port the M3TAL API daemon listens on.                                                   |
| 8081 | Traefik dashboard           | Host-local only                                | The internal Traefik dashboard port, accessible only from the host machine.                          |
| 8082 | M3TAL Dashboard             | Direct port (local mode) or via Traefik (traefik mode) | The port the M3TAL Dashboard container listens on internally. Access method depends on `DASHBOARD_EXPOSE_MODE`. |

Note: These are the primary M3TAL-managed ports. User-added Docker Compose stacks may expose additional ports on their own, depending on their configurations.
